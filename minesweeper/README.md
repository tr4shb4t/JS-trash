## Mine Clearance Simulator
Rudimentary version of Minesweeper, written with p5.js. First version includes
a difficulty slider, the ability to flag mines, and the satisfaction of knowing
the world is just a little bit safer, thanks to your humanitarian efforts.

## ROADMAP
* [] Clean up code. Fix redundancies and make it tidier.
* [] Make it look pretty. No CSS to speak of, nor is the true danger of 
this task properly conveyed.
* [] Implement option to change size of grid.
* [] Fix bug affecting flags on right edge. Currently obscures grid and reveals
surrounding cells in a weird way. Currently clueless as to why.
